      <h3>A timeline of Dr. Kober's life and career:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1894</strong> - Archeologist Arthur Evans publishes a paper identifying inscriptions from the ancient Cretan site of Knossos as a hitherto unknown writing system. This Mycenean writing would later be called Linear B, to contrast with the
          Minoan Linear A script, still undeciphered today.
          <li><strong>1906</strong> - Kober is born in the Manhattan neighborhood of Yorkville to parents who immigrated from Hungary.
            <li><strong>1924</strong> - Wins a scholarship that allows her to attend Hunter College. Here, she learns about the mystery of the Cretan scripts.
              <li><strong>1928</strong> - Graduates <em>magna cum laude</em> from Hunter, and announces that she intends to make decipherment of the Linear B script her life's work.
                <li><strong>1929</strong> - Earns a master's degree in classics from Columbia University.
                  <li><strong>Early 1930s</strong> - Studies a wide variety of disciplines on her own time to help her in deciphering the script, including archaeology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, statistics, and a host of languages ranging from Hittite
                    to Old Irish to Chinese.
                    <li><strong>1930</strong> - Begins teaching at Brooklyn College
                      <li><strong>1932</strong> - Earns a Ph.D. from Columbia University -- only three years after receiving her undergraduate degree, and while working as a teacher the entire time.
                        <li><strong>1935</strong> - Evans publishes volume 4 of <em>The Palace of Minos</em>, containing many new Linear B inscriptions and bringing the total up to 200. With this corpus in hand, Kober begins devoting a serious amount of time
                          to the decipherment of Linear B, using the statistical method of frequency analysis and filling up 40 notebooks with her work.
                          <li><strong>1941</strong> - Publishes her first (minor) paper on Linear B. At this point, the meaning of only one Linear B word is known, the word for "total," and it is not clear how even that is pronounced.
                            <li><strong>1943</strong> - Teaches herself Braille in order to provide books and exams for blind students, which she continues to do for several years.
                              <li><strong>1945</strong> - Publishes her first major paper on Linear B, revealing several of her methods. Unlike previous would-be decipherers, she refuses to assume any possible sound-values at the start, focusing on the form
                                and inflections of the symbols.
                                <li><strong>1946</strong> - Receives a Guggenheim Fellowship for a year, freeing her to work on deciphering Linear B full-time for the first time in her life. She learns still more languages, including obscure ones like Lycian
                                  and Carian, known by few in the world. She publishes her second major Linear B paper, identifying the grammatical function of a crucial "bridging" glyph in the script.
                                  <li><strong>1947</strong> - Travels to England to copy additional inscriptions from Sir John Myres. Although she had been refused access to crucial inscriptions from Pylos by Carl Blegen, Myres' cache enables her to make
                                    further advances. Her fellowship runs out and she has to resume teaching, but she makes another critical discovery, correctly identifying the glyph meaning "and."
                                    <li><strong>1948</strong> - Kober's third major paper is published, establishing the syllabic nature of the script and featuring a grid that identified the correspondences between different characters.
                                      <li><strong>1949</strong> - Kober publishes an article that establishes the existence of linguistic gender in Linear B and defines several more words correctly. With her health failing, it becomes difficult for her to
                                        work any longer.
                                        <li><strong>1950</strong> - Kober dies at the age of 43. Over the next few years, an architect named Michael Ventris would build on Kober's published work to identify the Linear B script as a form of Greek and
                                          finally decipher it. But he would not likely have succeeded if not for the huge amount of groundwork laid by Dr. Kober.
      </ul>

      <blockquote>"Ventris, in my opinion and in the opinion of historians of the decipherment, did not give [Alice Kober] due credit. Just before his untimely death in 1956, he did give a talk in which he acknowledged her work, but as we say in the book, it really
        was too little too late."
